# Power_Outage_Analysis

Objective:
Electric outages are a growing concern with significant energy demand and climate disasters.

Data:
Event level power outage data from 2002

Data had severe issues with data quality and integrity. I have used Excel and Python for data consolidation and data cleaning. Utilized Tableau for visualization.

The goal is to consolidate and clean up the raw data, and create a dashboard/report to help us understand patterns and trends around outages, quantify their impact on our communities, and identify possible weak points in the grid.
